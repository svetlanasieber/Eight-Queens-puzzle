# Eight Queens puzzle 
# Implement a recursive algorithm to solve the "8 Queens" puzzle. Our goal is to write a program to find all possible placements of 8 chess queens on a chessboard so that no two queens can attack each other (on a row, column, or diagonal).![image](https://github.com/svetlanasieber/Eight-Queens-puzzle/assets/135451084/616f2e26-e5c0-489f-b72d-1dcfab3c75dd)
